### Convergence IT Services
|Sr. No.|	Project/Task|	Description| Technologies|
|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|
|1|	Marksheet OCR|	It automated the document verification process by extracting data from scanned documents and validating it with the scraped data from official government websites. Basically it is combination of an OCR Project and Web Scraping (with captcha verification).| 	AWS Textract, Json, Flask, Regex|
|2|	Text Summarization|	This was an abstractive summarization algorithm from scrath. It was built by following the tensorflow's NMT approach. |	Tensorflow backend Keras Functional API, tf, Sequence to Sequence models, NLP, Neural Networks, RNN, LSTM, attention model, saving models, word embeddings, vocab, NMT.|
|3|	Fault Prediction POC|	In this POC we proposed a model to predict alarms on different Networking devices. The output from this model helped us to get the probability of any specific event occurring on any specific node within a specific time interval. The prediction output consists of the following: name of the Source Node, the dates for which the predictions are made, historical window and alarm labels with respective probabilities of occurrence. We implemented a research paper which proposed a sliding window approach by designing custom data transformation pipelines.|	Data Cleaning, Transformation, EDA, reading Research Papers, Co-ordinating with stake holders, Python, Numpy, Pandas, RFC, SVC, XGB, create testing pipeline.|
|4|	Document OCR|	A robust combination of Document Classification model and OCR Pipeline. The Document Classifier itself was ensemble of Image Classification and Text Classification. The Input data consisted of PNG, JPG, text based PDF, Scanned Image PDF, DOC, etc. data formats and 10 different classes like Purchase orders, AWB, Tax Invoices, etc. After successful classification, text data gets extracted by either pdf parsing, doc parsing or AWS Textract.|	Document classification, Text Classification, Image Classification, TF-IDF, CNN, OCR (Tesseract), AWS Textract, Rest Api.|
|5|	Aadhaar + Pan OCR|	A simple project to extract data from Aadhaar card and PAN card by using Google Vision for OCR.|	Google Vision, Json, Flask, Regex|
